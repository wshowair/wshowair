### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Wael. I was born and raised in ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡¬ then I moved to ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ since 2014. I have been working in the last 7 years as a web engineer with a big focus on frontend and a little bit of backend development using `Node.JS`. I used `AngularJS` & `Angular 2+` for about 3 years of my career. Later on âœ¨ `React` âœ¨ has become my favorite UI library for about 5 years till now. `Typescript` is my goto language and `Next.JS` becomes one of my favorite frameworks to use to build React applications.
Long story short, I am a continuous learner in the frontend industry.


Before my web development career I was working as an embedded software developer in the telecommunications industry. I enjoyed this journey of career where I can port C code into new hardware boards & writing linux device drivers.

# ðŸ“« How to reach me:

Take a look on my personal website https://dev-bits.ca that I have built using _Astro_ . It is not finished 100% as I wish. But part of my working mentality is to ship **MVP** (Minimal Valiable Product) then improve it as it grows instead of waiting to make it look perfect. 



# âš¡ Fun fact:
If you don't know how to pronounce my name. Here is a little equation helper for you `Wael=Y+L`
